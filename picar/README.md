# PiCar 1.0

With PiCar and a Raspberry Pi(TM) you can control a radio-controlled car. The software offers you a mode to manually control the vehicle, but also an autonomous drive mode, the "NaviX" engine, which enables the car to drive even through an unknown area using an ultrasonic sensor. The "NaviX" engine is also able to bring back your vehicle to its starting position. The "LumiX" engine offers several features to provide visual feedback and the "MoviX" engine communicates with the motors of the RC-car. You can control your car using a command-line interface (CLI). PiCar has been discontinued on January 30, 2017. You can still use the software and build your own projects using PiCar, but I will not longer provide any patches or support. 

## News
+ January 30, 2017 - It has been a great journey with PiCar. Eventhough, I will not longer continue this project. Thanks for your support!
+ May 13, 2016 - Right now, there is much to do, so PiCar will still have to rest a bit longer, but I will continue in
  Summer!
+ April 9, 2016 - From now on, all commits on the PiCar repo are signed with valid GPG keys!

## Setup

To operate correctly, we strongly recommend to connect your RasPi with a WiFi network using an additional USB-WiFi-plug. For autonomous drive you also need an ultrasonic sensor (tested: HC-SR04) which is installed at the front of the vehicle. 

1. Download the archive and unpack it.
2. Install and wire the motors of your RC-car with the Ryanteck MCB and plug it on your RasPi.
3. Connect lighting (if available) to pin 24 and GROUND.
4. Move to the "picar"-directory and execute start.py as root.
5. Type "selftest" to check the correct wiring of your motors and if needed change the wiring.
6. Report every bug to me! picar.infoandbugs@gmail.com
7. To enable the experimental features remove the '#' before the code parts marked as experimental. USAGE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Usage

After starting the program, you can use the following commands:

+ forwards - moves the car forwards
+ backwards - moves the car backwards
+ left /right forwards - makes your car turn left or right forwards
+ left /right backwards - makes your car turn left or right backwards
+ selftest - for checking the functionality of every motor
+ distance - shows the current distance to the next object using the ultrasonic sensor
+ stealth - the lighting is switched off
+ light - the lighting is switched on
+ auto - activating autonomous drive
+ quit - quit the application
+ help - show command overview
+ update - starts update.sh
+ turn over - the car turns by 180°
+ come back - the car comes back to its starting point
+ clear directions - clears the cache of NaviX Comeback 
+ network status - checks if PiCar is online
